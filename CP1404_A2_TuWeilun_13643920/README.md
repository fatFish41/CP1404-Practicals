_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
Well, it takes me about two weeks time to complete the assignment. 
The longest time was taken by kivy, I really spend lots on it. 
The problem should on the computer system, however at the end I get it done. 
(Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. 
See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history))

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The most satisfied to me is I get the job done which I had never touch before.
I feel great on it cause it takes time and effort, I see there are many people still 
waiting for somebody's help but that will never work

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The least satisfied to me is my code cause sometimes I really connot find the error but it keep running off.
At that moment I do hopeless, but there is good friend around me and teach me, thats why I can get it done.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
I think the best i did should be organize all the codes well. There are in order in function no like what I did
in my first assignment.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I need to have idea cause this i was spend too many time on it which does not needed. My friend has done it within a day
and I spend two weeks time to finish. I got to speed up and write better code next time

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Well,  when we talk about the resources, there is a lot such as your friends and teacher, they are really helpful.
By the way there are some online resources on the internet which can help you in your codes but not to do the work
for you.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
Challenges? It must be the kivy part, I find a lot of resources online but it does work(I think there is some problem in my computer 
cause my friends' computer does work) However, I did not give up and I go and find many people. Some of them also do not know what
to do but i keep looking for the person who knows how to do it. Of cause, at the end, I get done.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
The answer is of cause, before when I coding I does not have that many class. My teacher really do like it.
I feel it is hard to when I just start coding but after I use it, it was noy that difficult as what I think.
And it is really useful and powerful, I can find my error easier by using the code.
